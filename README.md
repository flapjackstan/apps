# Apps

Collection of apps that I use for different purposes and have saved as an `alias` on my local machine

`timer` - I mostly use this as a pomodoro app or as a timer for making an aeropress.

`dates` - Date calculator with two uses. 1) Provided a spcific date calculate the date ahead or back n days. 2) Calculate the days between 2 dates. Used this as like a reminder of how many days until the next holiday and little stuff like that.
